## GPX to JSON
A small python script designed to parse GPX tracks with multiple line segments into GeoJSON. Most scripts/websites that do this seemingly presume that there is only one segment when a GPX file may contain hundreds.

## Usage
Script uses Python 3. Download/git clone the script and run it with "python GPXtoJSON.py." Make sure you change the file paths in the script before you begin, you'll need to add the path to the GPX file and where you want to .json file to end up
